PyPV
====

Multiplatform Python 2.7 graphical user interface for measuring current versus voltage curves using a Keithley2400 multimeter. 

Designed for evaluating performances of photovoltaic devices in research institutions, currently used in link:https://iciq.es/[ICIQ (Institut Català d'Investigació Química)], in link:http://www.urv.cat/[URV (Universitat Rovira i Vrigili)], and in link:http://www.ikc.edu.tr/[İzmir Katip Çelebi Üniversitesi].

Installation
------------

Linux
~~~~~

Install Python 2.7 from your distro's package manager, likely the package will be named `python2`.
Install PyVisa `python2-pyvisa`, PyVisa-py `python2-pyvisa-py` or NationalInstruments-vISA (very hard to install), PyQt4 `python2-pyqt4`, MatPlotLib `python2-matplotlib`, NumPy `python2-numpy`, Linux-GPIB `python2-linux-gpib` and `linux-gpib`.

Run with:
```
python2 PyPV.py
```

Windows
~~~~~~~

Install:

- Python 2.7 (compatible also with Windows XP) from link:https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/[here] (do not use Python 3 as it is not supported by PyPV), a direct link (updated 2019-01) for 64bit operating systems is link:https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.15/python-2.7.15.amd64.msi[this] and for older 32bit operating systems, like Windows XP, is link:https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.15/python-2.7.15.msi[this].
- PyQt4 for Python 2.7 from link:https://sourceforge.net/projects/pyqt/files/PyQt4/PyQt-4.11.4/PyQt4-4.11.4-gpl-Py2.7-Qt4.8.7-x64.exe/download[here for 64bit operating systems] and link:https://sourceforge.net/projects/pyqt/files/PyQt4/PyQt-4.11.4/PyQt4-4.11.4-gpl-Py2.7-Qt4.8.7-x32.exe/download[here for older 32bit operating systems], like Windows XP (4.11.4 is the latest version for which the installer is available).
- NationalInstruments drivers (NI-488.2) Runtime from link:http://www.ni.com/es-es/support/downloads/drivers/download.ni-488-2.html[here] (login required, otherwise a direct link for download (updated 2019-01) is link:http://download.ni.com/support/softlib/gpib/Windows/18.5/NI488Runtime_1850.exe[this], in case Runtime was not enough (I'm not sure) you can download the full NI-488.2 from link:http://download.ni.com/support/softlib/gpib/Windows/18.5/NI4882_1850f1.exe[here]).
- NationalInstruments VISA (NI-VISA) Run-Time Engine from link:http://www.ni.com/en-gb/support/downloads/drivers/download.ni-visa.html[here] (login required, otherwise a direct link for download (updated 2019-01) is link:http://download.ni.com/support/softlib/visa/NI-VISA/18.5/Windows/NIVISA1850runtime.exe[this], in case Runtime was not enough (I'm not sure), you can download the full NI-VISA from link:http://download.ni.com/support/softlib/visa/NI-VISA/18.5/Windows/NIVISA1850full.exe[here]).
- MatPlotLib as explained link:https://matplotlib.org/users/installing.html[here] and detailed below.
- PyVISA as explained link:https://pyvisa.readthedocs.io/en/master/getting.html[here] and detailed below.

Make sure Keithley is on and connected via GPIB-USB to the computer (support for non-USB connections can be added, for example for connection via serial cable, but is not yet implemented in PyPV).

Run with double click on `PyPV.py` file.

Guide for installing MatPlotLib and PyVISA
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Open DOS command prompt (on modern Windows click on Start menu and type `cmd`, on old Windows click on Start menu, click Run and then type `cmd`).

Enter the Python 2.7 installation folder using `cd c:\Python27` command.

Update the pip installer with the `python -m pip install -U pip` command, if it fails try reinstalling Python.

Install MatPlotLib with the `python -m pip install -U matplotlib` command.

Install PyVISA with the `python -m pip install -U pyvisa` command.

Test Mode
---------

For trying the software without a connected Keithley set to 1 the "TEST_MODE" variable in "mainwindow.py" file.
